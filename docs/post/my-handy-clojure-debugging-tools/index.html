        <h1>My handy Clojure debugging tools</h1>
        <div>
                <time>August 26, 2024</time>
            </div>
    </header><p>In this blog post, I’d like to share how my debugging tools for Clojure have evolved over the past years. Let&rsquo;s start with each tool</p>
<p><strong><code>(println …)</code></strong></p>
<p>It is the most versatile technique. There is no learning curve. Focus on tapping at the right places, make the assertions, and move on. The only downside would be there is quite a lot of typing and undo-ing after the fact</p>
<p><strong><code>(defn x [x] (println x) x)</code></strong></p>
<p>In the next version, I almost always wrap println in a function in the same namespace, slurp, and raise the forms. This helps speed up typing a little bit. We still have to undo changes</p>
<p><strong><code>(def state (atom nil))</code></strong><br>
<strong><code>(defn x [x] (reset! state x))</code></strong></p>
<p>Very useful to capture any data that goes beyond primitive values. Deref the state. Now you can manipulate the data.</p>
<p><strong>IDE debuggers</strong></p>
<p>I have my fair share of trying out different debugger tools: cider debugger, enlighten, cursive debuggers, etc. They are handy for tracing codebases. They automatically follow the callstacks, often leading you to code branches that you did not expect.</p>
<p>But in practice, I don&rsquo;t use them as much - mainly because I feel like they can be a bit distracting due to how we generally instrument the breakpoints, hitting next/up/down the call stack, inspecting values, etc.</p>
<p>They are definitely useful as a starting point in big and unfamiliar codebases</p>
<p><strong>Clojure libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/dgrnbrg/spyscope">spyscope</a>, <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hashp">hashp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/scope-capture">scope-capture</a>, <a href="http://www.flow-storm.org/">FlowStorm</a>, etc</strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of excellent functions and macros that help with debugging. Some printout recursive calls nicely. I tend to fall back to something simple like a hashp. It gets the job done nicely. Saves some typing</p>
<p>Then one day, when I was pairing with my colleague Craig Ludington; he used a combination of println, atom, and reader macro - all at once; which I thought was pretty cool. I ended up modifying and extending his debug code but I want to give credit back to him - Thank you, Craig!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have this (hypothetical) code:
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/d01208f7c48b40c44db89905b14bf0cd.js"></script>
</p>
<p>And the ask is to modify such that if the <code>loan-amount</code> input was 10000.50, the output should be <code>:modest</code>, not <code>:small</code></p>
<p>We can add a reader tag that looks like this
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/d3e015fb667253c543af3b2318acd8b0.js"></script>
</p>
<p>Then run the code <code>(calculate-loan-size 10000.50)</code></p>
<p>We can call <code>(user/tags)</code> to print out the debug tags. On emacs, I set the shortcut command+6 and command+5 to clear out the tags
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/c387742ef299e175c13dc294893bb104.js"></script>
</p>
<ol>
<li>0, 1, 2, and 3 corresponds to 4 forms that are being the debugged</li>
<li>1 and <code>:same-values</code> indicates there we only 1 call and all of them have the same values. It is useful to know when we have multiple calls (intentional or not) and if the values are the same</li>
<li><code>(between 1 loan-amount 10000)</code> is self explanatory</li>
<li><code>false</code> is the return value</li>
</ol>
<p>We can pull the value out with the index <code>(user/logs 0)</code> or with form <code>(user/logs '(between 1 loan-amount 10000))</code></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dvliman/.clojure/blob/cb2153279931f3537140d8a84335a73fbf989147/user.clj#L11">user/logs</a> takes variadic function. For example, if we capture an HTTP request map, we can do <code>(user/logs 0 last :header #(get % &quot;Content-Type&quot;))</code></p>
<p>This is how it is implemented in my <code>~/.clojure/user.clj</code>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/9ae80ebbba797fde22e0f1915ce9f93c.js"></script>
</p>
<p>And <code>~/.clojure/data_readers.clj</code>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/c70d3e88b88d3d623e2eec2d7fce68b6.js"></script>
</p>
<p>I can load this code in any project i.e in the <code>deps.edn</code>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/9172a211270c38c0104d32e0579429f1.js"></script>
</p>
<p>On emacs, I have set the keybindings to:
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/65ee959b2d498075bdf5e5d3075b5e8b.js"></script>
</p>
<p>and the definitions:
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/93c1df9f053565de880392d966ee0572.js"></script>
</p>
<p>With combinations of keyboard shortcuts, emacs buffers, and REPL, this makes debugging a lot faster (for me)</p>
<p>I hope this is useful for someone. I would love hear your thoughts on how you debug your clojure code!</p>
