    </header><p>I want to echo <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack">John Carmack</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1258531455220609025">tweet that all giant companies use open-source FFmpeg in the backends</a>. <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> is a core piece of technology that powers our live-streaming and recording system at Inspire Fitness. It certainly is high-quality open-source software that we use to record and stream countless hours of workout videos.</p>
<p>It looks like this:

</figure>
</p>
<h1 id="users-can">Users can:</h1>
<ol>
<li>watch live-streaming content, or</li>
<li>playback on-demand videos from our content library</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="high-level">High level</h1>
<p>Behind the scene, we have:</p>
<ol>
<li>IP cameras are wired up in each studio room.</li>
<li>The cameras support the RTSP protocol.</li>
<li>A software pipeline integrated with our custom CMS to broadcast (stream) our cameras feed to the internet while simultaneously recording and storing the content to AWS S3 storage for on-demand playback.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="how-it-all-works-together">How it all works together:</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We configure classes (the recordings) to start at a particular time in our dashboard. The time aligns with our studio schedules, where gym members would often join our classes to work out alongside the instructors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html">kick off a dedicated ec2 instance with FFmpeg baked in an AMI image</a> when the class starts. We call this our encoder/transcoder.
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/2aa587f7b024615e4697da7b48a00120.js"></script>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as the ec2 boots up, it runs the cloud-init script, which starts the Clojure process and <a href="https://github.com/tolitius/mount">mount</a> (a state management library) that would then starts the dependencies:
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/e4a63a35091e83ebae3d29d34ade450a.js"></script>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This would in turn calls <code>start-stream</code>:
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/607974927b33b0e734de3704976bb32f.js"></script>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>start-stream</code> logic is actually pretty simple. It pulls feed from our camera and egress out our CDN partner
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/dvliman/e604c2981bfb691803d84bd0b4858e39.js"></script>

The output would be a playback URL that our video player would be pulling from.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice we are essentially invoking the FFmpeg that we bundled earlier to:</p>
<ol>
<li>take input from RTSP transport protocol</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html">argument flags for the video/audio codec</a></li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>What it does</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-re</td>
<td>read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab device i.e if you wanted to stream a video file, then you would want this, otherwise it might stream too fast</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-c:a aac</td>
<td>transcode to AAC codec</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-ar 48000</td>
<td>set the audio sample rate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-b:a 128k</td>
<td>set the audio bitrate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-c:v h264 or copy</td>
<td>transcode to h264 codec or simply send the frame verbatim to output</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-hls_time</td>
<td>the duration for video segment length</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-f flv</td>
<td>says to deliver the output stream in an flv wrapper</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rtmp://</td>
<td>is where the transcoded video stream get pushed to</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The code is essentially a shell wrapper to FFmpeg command-line arguments. FFmpeg is the swiss-army tool for all video/audio codecs</p>
<p>The whole <code>encoder.clj</code> is about 300 lines long with error handling. It handles file uploads (video segment files, FFmpeg logs for debugging), egress to primary and secondary/fallback RTMP slot, shutdown processes, and the ec2 instance when we are done with the recording.</p>
<h1 id="lesson-learned">Lesson learned</h1>
<p>This was a rescue project from Go to Clojure. The previous architecture had too many moving pieces, making HTTP requests across multiple micro-services. The main server would crash daily due to improper handling of WebSocket messages, causing messages to be lost and encoder instances not starting up on time.</p>
<p>The rewrite reduced the complexities. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4">Simple Made Easy</a> as <a href="https://clojure.org/about/history">Rich Hickey</a>.</p>
<p>Rewriting a project is never a good approach considering the opportunity cost. I evaluated a few offerings: <a href="http://mux.com">mux.com</a>, Cloudflare Stream, Amazon IVS. On paper, they have all the building blocks we need. In addition, some have features like video analytics, policing/signing playback URL, which would be useful for us.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fact that we still had 2 years contract with the CDN company was why we still manage our encoder.</p>
<p>In hindsight, if we consider the storage costs and S3 egress bandwidth fee on top of the CDN costs, I would probably go for ready-made solutions for our company stage. I would start optimizing when we have more traffic.</p>
<p>The good thing is that this system works really well for live-streaming workload with programmatic access. (Sidenote: barring occasional internet hiccups in our studio).</p>
<p>If you have a video production pipeline that involves heavy video editing, going with prebuilt software could be more flexible until you solidify the core functionalities.</p>
