      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am David Liman.
I am a software engineer with over a decade of experience building backend services. I have worked in different industries, from advertising, medical, fintech, and fitness space.
I am a technologist and a problem solver. I always look for simple solutions to complex problems. My ideal role would involve designing, building, documenting, and maintaining systems. I am happiest when I can alternate high-level and low-level work.</description>
