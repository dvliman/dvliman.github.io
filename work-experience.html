     I worked on many product features such as chat rooms and chat bots, do-not-disturb auto-forwarding, etc.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">As the business grows, we also helped evolved our chat server from pure secure messaging system to a communication
     platform (moving off from XMPP to HTTP Server Sent Event with API support). We built a number of services such as
     SMTP email gateway, push notifications services for iOS (APNS) and Android (GCM),
     document / image conversion system powered by a Redis-based worker queues</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">Thanks to our efforts, TigerText is used as a reliable message delivery system by many hospitals
     and health care organizations in the U.S.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">Personally, I learned a lot building highly concurrent, fault-tolerant servers and functional programming.

    deals database, product listings and images that we scrapped from merchants and manufacturers. Some features include
    custom coupon ranking, similar coupons, social network integrations.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">I enjoyed my time here as the company culture allows us to experiment; be creative.
    I hacked up a product-category classifier using Naive Bayes algorithm from python <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a> library, built image resizing http proxy in Scala with <a href="https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage">sksamuel/scrimage</a>. Played with Docker before orchestration layer matures.
