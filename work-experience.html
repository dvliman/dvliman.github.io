     called KSI (Keyless Signing Infrastructure). I am also looking into permissioned blockchain applications.</p><h3 class="tracked f4 bb measure">Tigertext (2015 - 2018)</h3><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">I was a Platform Engineer at TigerText in charge of a real-time messaging platform that was written in Erlang.
     I worked on many product features such as chat rooms, chat bots, do-not-disturb auto-forwarding, CSV importer for nurses's schedules, etc.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">As the business grows, we also helped evolved our chat server from only a secure messaging system to a communication
     platform (moving off from XMPP to HTTP Server Sent Event with API support). We built a number of services such as
     SMTP email gateway, push notifications, document / image conversion system powered by a Redis-based worker queues</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">Thanks to the team's efforts, TigerText is used by many hospitals
     and health care organizations in the U.S. as a reliable message delivery system.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">Personally, I learned a lot building highly concurrent, fault-tolerant servers and functional programming.
    Thanks to Erlang and OTP Framework</p><h3 class="tracked f4 bb measure">Zipfworks (2014 - 2015)</h3><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">Zipfworks is an ideation / media lab that owns a few digital products such as
     BluePromoCode (a coupon site), StyleSpotter (fashion aggregator site).</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">As a Backend Engineer, I worked on building API that powers our
    deals database, product listings and images that we scrapped from merchants and manufacturers. Some features include
    custom coupon ranking, similar coupons, social network integrations.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">I enjoyed my time here as the company culture allows us to experiment and be creative.
    I hacked up a product-category classifier using Naive Bayes algorithm from python <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a> library, built image resizing http proxy in Scala with <a href="https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage">sksamuel/scrimage</a>. Played with Docker before orchestration layer matures. Fun time.</p><h3 class="tracked f4 bb measure">OneScreen, Data Engineer (2010 - 2011) and (2013 - 2014)</h3><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">I had one year internship before I was re-hired again as a Data Engineer.
    My first task was to maintain a data pipeline that runs <a href="https://github.com/twitter/scalding">Scalding</a> (MapReduce jobs)
    on log files from our ads servers that is already nicely bucketed per hour in S3. The end results get stored
    in <a href="https://www.vertica.com/">Vertica.</a></p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">The MapReduce job computes watch counts, video-view quartiles, device type, and
    a bunch of other dimensions that we use for reporting & billing purposes.</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">Unfortunately, the company went under 6 months after I joined. I really enjoyed
    the scales and technical challenges in ad-tech industry. </p><h3 class="tracked f4 bb measure">IBM, Software Engineer (2011 - 2013)</h3><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">IBM was my first job out of college. Interestingly, I got the offer by participating
    IBM ICPC Programing Contest <a href="http://socalcontest.org/history/2011/details-2011.shtml">(CPP Team 4!)</a></p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">I worked on a project called Lifecycle Query Engine. It indexes <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF triplets</a> and process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> queries</p><p class="f3 lh-copy measure">I remember doing everything from building web UI with Dojo Toolkit (IBM's internal web framework)
    to working on Java server deployed on Tomcat and IBM Websphere. I was tuning a bunch of knobs so that we can fetch
    RDF resource as much as possible while serving simple-to-complex query templates</p></header></main></body></head></html>
