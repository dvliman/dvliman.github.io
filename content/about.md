Hi there üëã, I am David Liman.

I am a software engineer with two decades of experience building backend services. I have worked in different industries, from advertising, medical, fintech, and fitness space.

I am a technologist and a problem solver. I always look for simple solutions to complex problems.
My ideal role would involve designing, building, documenting, and maintaining systems. 
I am happiest when I can alternate high-level and low-level work.

I believe people do their best thinking when they come together to solve problems when they are supported, respected, and growing. I find bottom-up leadership more appealing.

## Location
I am based in Los Angeles, California but prefer to work as part of a mostly or fully distributed teams.
