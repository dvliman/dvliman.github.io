Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am David

I am a product-focused engineer with subject matter experience in travel tech, finance, health & wellness space.

I believe people do their best thinking when they are supported, respected, and growing. I find bottom-up leadership more appealing. I prefer to work in the [following environment](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2025/02/09/2025-skunks.html) although I learned to adapt to many environments.
