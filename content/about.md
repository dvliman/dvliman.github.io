Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am David Liman. I am a product-focused engineer. Subject matter experience in travel tech, fintech, health & wellness space. I am also an avid trader.

I believe people do their best thinking when they are supported, respected, and growing. I find bottom-up leadership more appealing.
